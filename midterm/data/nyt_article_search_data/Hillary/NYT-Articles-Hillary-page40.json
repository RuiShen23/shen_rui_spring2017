No one knows that better than the troglodytes on the Federal Election Commission who would love to poke all sorts of crippling loopholes in the nation's brand new campaign finance law. Unfortunately, some of the Senate Democrats who supported reform are now wavering over whether to let the commission get away with this high-handed maneuver. Among the tremulous lawmakers is Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has not decided whether to join in overturning the commission's most recent regulations. Mrs. Clinton voted for the McCain-Feingold ''soft money'' ban and notes that she disavowed soft money in her Senate campaign in 2000. But her record will be seriously tarnished if she does not block the election commission's attempt to use the rule-making process to eviscerate the law. At issue are a set of regulations that delineate the law's ban on raising, directing or receiving unlimited funds from corporations, unions and rich donors for state parties. A four-vote majority on the commission adopted the narrowest possible definition of what was banned, opening the possibility that presidents, senators or other officeholders could, with a wink and a nod, suggest that donors make such contributions.
