A long time ago, of course, lots of people did not like First Lady Clinton because of her hairdo, but those were innocent days and since then, our country has become much more sophisticated in ways not to like a person. There are, for example, columnists in this paper who do not like her because at first she liked the war and then she didn't like the war, but even today, she doesn't not like the war enough. There are Democrats who would like to like her, but do not like her because not enough other people like her and therefore, she could ruin the Democrats' electoral chances against the Republicans, who the Democrats don't like more than they don't like this potential nominee. The Republicans do not like her because even though she has liked some of the things they like, still it appears that she has not found it in her heart to not like most of the things they do not like - for instance, people. Bill, I have heard it said in certain circles, does not like his wife, but who am I to tell you who Bill likes or does not like, although I can tell you that I met Bill once and he did not seem to \"like\" me, if you know what I mean.", "slideshow_credits": null, "multimedia": [], "news_desk": null, "abstract": "Patricia Marx on the number of L's in Hillary.", "subsection_name": null, "_id": "4fd365738eb7c8105d8b4a56", "byline": {"person": [{"role": "reported", "rank": 1, "organization": "", "firstname": "Patricia", "lastname": "MARX"}], "original": "By PATRICIA MARX"}, "source": "The New York Times", "blog": [], "headline": {"kicker": "Summer in the City", "main": "Hillary: What's Not to Like?"}, "section_name": "Opinion", "pub_date": "2006-08-11T22:38:26Z", "type_of_material": "Blog", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "value": "News", "name": "type_of_material"}], "word_count": 510, "web_url": "http://summercity.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/08/11/hillary-whats-not-to-like/", "print_page": null, "snippet": "Patricia Marx on the number of L's in Hillary...."}, {"document_type": "blogpost", "lead_paragraph": "Brooklyn City Councilman Bill de Blasio, a seasoned political operative, may be smarting today.
