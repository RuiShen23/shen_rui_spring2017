But in spirit it is a world unto itself, a left-wing enclave where Beat poets once found refuge and the city council recently made the whole town a bird sanctuary. Besides being the home of the 1,000-student Naropa University, which describes itself as Buddhist but nonsectarian, Boulder is the site of the University of Colorado, which adds 26,000 students to the town's resident population of almost 100,000. A local technology boom in the mid-90's sent real estate prices climbing and brought an influx of outdoorsy young professionals now intent on preserving their well-heeled bohemian utopia. Boulder is indeed a nice place to live, but it's also a great place to visit, particularly when winter temperatures rise into the 50's even as snow covers the Rockies at the western edge of town. HILLARY ROSNER Friday 7:30 p.m. 1) Home on the Free Range For quick immersion into the Boulder groove, have dinner at Sunflower (1701 Pearl Street, 303-440-0220), which serves nourishing organic fare -- with free-range meats -- that appeals to a sophisticated sensibility. The choices include elk and buffalo, but try the tempeh scaloppine, seasoned soy-based patties saut\u00e9ed in a white wine sauce and served with Yukon Gold mashed potatoes ($17.50). Also excellent is the seitan and mushroom Burgundy, a rich dish made with portobello and shiitake mushrooms in a red wine shallot sauce ($17.95). After dinner, relax at Southern Sun (627 South Broadway), a ski-lodge-style establishment where you may feel out of place if you're not wearing fleece. Kick back at a communal table or on a comfy couch and order Mountain Sun's delicious Isadore Java, a porter brewed with coffee. Find an opponent for checkers or Scrabble, but don't get too serious -- one night last week a Scrabble set had several letters missing.", "slideshow_credits": null, "multimedia": [], "news_desk": "Escapes", "abstract": "Journeys article on 36-hour visit to Boulder, Colo; photos; maps (M)", "subsection_name": null, "_id": "4fd227ca8eb7c8105d7b060b", "byline": {"person": [{"role": "reported", "rank": 1, "organization": "", "firstname": "Hillary", "lastname": "ROSNER"}], "original": "By HILLARY ROSNER"}, "source": "The New York Times", "blog": [], "headline": {"kicker": "JOURNEYS", "main": "36 Hours | Boulder, Colo."}, "section_name": "Travel", "pub_date": "2002-12-20T00:00:00Z", "type_of_material": "News", "keywords": [{"value": "COLORADO", "name": "glocations"}, {"value": "BOULDER (COLO)", "name": "glocations"}, {"value": "TRAVEL AND VACATIONS", "name": "subject"}], "word_count": 1579, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/20/travel/journeys-36-hours-boulder-colo.html", "print_page": "4", "snippet": "BOULDER shares dazzling winter sunshine and mountain views with Denver, half an hour away, and the ski areas a bit farther afield.
